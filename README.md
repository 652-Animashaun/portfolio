# Portfolio Webapp


Fulfilling the portfolio personal branding part of the aoftware developer digital footprints. 
Apparently it is of general opinion that software engineers should have a personal website for:

1. Showcasing Skills and Projects: A portfolio provides a platform to display a developer's skills, projects, and achievements. It allows them to highlight the range and depth of their technical expertise, giving potential employers or clients a tangible demonstration of their capabilities.
2. Professional Branding: A portfolio website contributes to a developer's professional branding. It serves as a personalized space where they can articulate their unique value proposition, share their professional journey, and stand out in a competitive job market.
Online Presence: In the digital age, having an online presence is essential. A portfolio website acts as a centralized and easily accessible hub where others can learn about a developer's background, skills, and accomplishments, making it convenient for recruiters, collaborators, or clients to find and evaluate them.
3. Networking and Collaboration: A portfolio provides a means for networking and collaboration. It allows developers to connect with peers, potential clients, or collaborators in the industry. It serves as a reference point for professional interactions and can lead to valuable opportunities.
4. Job Search and Recruitment: When job hunting, having a well-curated portfolio can set a developer apart. Recruiters often look for tangible evidence of skills and past projects. A portfolio website makes it easier for hiring managers to assess a developer's abilities and suitability for a role.
Continuous Learning and Growth: Maintaining a portfolio encourages continuous learning and skill development. It motivates developers to showcase their latest projects, technologies, and accomplishments, reflecting a commitment to staying current and evolving in a dynamic field.

Which without even trying so hard, is what this porject has become for me in many ways. 
Obviosuly it is an ongoing project and look and feel will change as time goes on.
